# Cross-device Conversion Tracking template for GTM

Mediasmart Cross-device Conversion Tracking allows tracking conversions on CTV programmatic campaigns that run on mediasmartâ€™s DSP using Google Tag Manager.

For accurate tracking, the event id and event number need to be added to the click tracker and made transferrable to the landing page. This template shares the IP with Mediasmart to asses if the IP has been seen before or not. Those advertisers using this template must make sure that the user grants consent before triggering the tag associated to this template.

See https://console.mediasmart.io/docs/introduction for more information.
